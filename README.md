# card-designer
Tool for ID card design

It was developed in 2000 for the access control system of the Textile Factory of Santa Clara, Cuba. It was made with Delphi 4 for Microsoft Windows. The program allowed hundreds of cards to be printed and was used for a few years, but with the change of the factory access system the program was no longer used.

HOW IT WORKS

A password is requested for operate the program. As initial password it uses the word "pinlaso", without quotation. Later, the password can be changed. It uses the windows registry for storing the password. In the main window you must enter the name, position, department, ID number, and access level of the employee. Also, the employee's photo needs to be uploaded. A preview of the card is shown at the bottom, and changes are automatically updated as you enter the data. The ID number is shown as a bar code. You need to install the font "code 128" in your system to be able to see the bar codes. When the ID card is done, you add it to the report page which can arranges up to 10 ID cards. The report can be printed or saved for a latter use.
